# Project Proposal: Mealspot üçΩÔ∏èüçäüí∏
Proposal by Charlotte Lin

### Project title
Mealspot

### What and why?

Mealspot is a budget-focused meal planning app. Everyone needs to eat, and it‚Äôs frustrating when dinnertime comes and you have no idea what to get or make. Meal planning can help, but it can be stressful and time-consuming coming up with ideas, searching for relevant recipes, and writing grocery lists. Mealspot reduces that problem by condensing all those tasks into one convenient, easy-to-use app. The next issue Mealspot tackles is overspending on food. Oftentimes, we view the healthiness and completeness of our meals as a trade-off with cost and convenience. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way ‚Äì Mealspot tracks the cost of dining out, takeout, and groceries to help you keep your weekly food expenses within your budget. Mealspot will help people eat better food for a smaller price (and take the stress out of doing it), leading to more financially secure, healthier, and happier lifestyles.

### For whom?

Mealspot is perfect for college students, who are often on strict budgets and may also struggle with planning their own meals for the first time in their lives (for example: me). It‚Äôs also ideal for people who run households and need to stay on budget when it comes to getting food for their family (for example: my mother). Basically, Mealspot works for anyone who wants to save money when it comes to food ‚Äì and everyone needs to eat (for example: you).

### How?

* Fill out a weekly meal plan with what you plan to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks each day, which you can check throughout the week
* Set a weekly budget for your food expenses this week, and the app tracks how close you are getting to that budget (or if you went over budget)
* Search for recipes to include in your meal plans, with recommendations based on user preferences
* Upload ingredients and food items you already have at home, and the app will prioritize recipe recommendations that use those ingredients
* Automatically create a grocery list based on your meal plan
* Mealspot provides budget-saving optimizations for your grocery list, such as ‚Äúswap suggestions‚Äù (e.g. if one recipe uses spinach and another uses kale, you can just use spinach for both recipes to eliminate the need to buy two different vegetables ‚Äì the app will automatically find and make these swap suggestions. It can also recommend cheaper alternatives for certain ingredients).

### Scope

Building the front-end functionality, including the meal planner, recipe search interface, uploading existing food, and grocery list probably takes a few weeks. Building the algorithms for recommending recipes, automatically creating the grocery list from the ingredients of recipes, checking the budget, and optimizing the grocery list probably also takes a few weeks. We would also have to somehow get the recipes, which I think would take a couple weeks. Finally, we will have to set up the database and put everything together. None of these issues are trivial, but they also do not require inventing any brand new technology, so I think they are within the scope for this class. Since coding most of the proposed features isn‚Äôt overly complicated, the team can focus on making them functional, polished, and user-friendly. I see this as an approximately ten-week project for a team of 4-6 programmers, which is about how much time we have in the semester. The features I‚Äôve outlined can be easily added/complicated or removed/simplified if my time estimate is off.
